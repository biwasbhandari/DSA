# 30-Day DSA Learning Roadmap: Comprehensive Guide with Prerequisite Knowledge

## Pre-Roadmap Preparation

### Fundamental Learning Rules:
1. No LLM/AI assistance for solving problems.
2. Solve problems independently.
3. Time-box problem-solving (45-60 minutes per problem).
4. Always draw out solutions on paper first.
5. Break down problems into smaller components.
6. Maintain a detailed problem-solving journal.

### Holistic Learning Approach:
- Completely understand the problem's context and requirements.
- Design a comprehensive solution on paper.
- Implement the solution methodically.
- Rigorously analyze and optimize time/space complexity.
- Systematically compare your solution with alternative approaches.

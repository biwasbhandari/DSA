# 30-Day DSA Learning Roadmap

## Pre-Roadmap Preparation

### Rules for Learning:
1. No LLM/AI assistance for solving problems.
2. Solve problems independently.
3. Time-box your problem-solving (45-60 minutes per problem).
4. Always draw out your solution on paper first.
5. Learn to break down problems into smaller components.
6. Maintain a problem-solving journal.

### Learning Approach:
- Understand the problem completely.
- Design a solution on paper.
- Implement the solution.
- Optimize and analyze time/space complexity.
- Compare your solution with others after solving.

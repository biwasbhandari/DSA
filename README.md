# 30-Day DSA Learning Roadmap

## Pre-Roadmap Preparation
### Rules for Learning:
1. No LLM/AI assistance for solving problems
2. Solve problems independently
3. Time-box your problem-solving (45-60 minutes per problem)
4. Always draw out your solution on paper first
5. Learn to break down problems into smaller components
6. Maintain a problem-solving journal

### Learning Approach:
- Understand the problem completely
- Design a solution on paper
- Implement the solution
- Optimize and analyze time/space complexity
- Compare your solution with others after solving
